# Target Practice
A simulation of finding anomalies in data sets related to player directional movement in FPS games.

## What's featured?  
- A basic 3D-space setup with Entities (actors) and Shots (bullets). Entities can shoot to create bullets, which act as a single moving point in space.
- Tests on data sets: checking for linear functions created from player's aim, checking for "frame jumping/skips" (no function/graph made when aiming, only disconnected points)

## The Results  
- When a player is aiming, it's very unlikely that a linear function will be formed by the way the mouse drags. This would imply each point in the vector created is a magnitude of itself, and thus the mouse was dragged in a perfect diagonal line. Dragging the mouse in a perfect diagonal line in a fast-paced setting is very unlikely for humans, and repeated instances of this definitely suggests cheats are being used.


More techniques will be added over time, thanks for taking an interest.
